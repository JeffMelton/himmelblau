## Development Setup

Himmelblau is written in **Rust**, with packaging support for major Linux distributions.

### Prerequisites
The only build requirements are `git`, `make`, and either `docker` or `podman`. All remaining build requirements will be installed in a container automatically.

### Build
To build packages for your host distro (where supported):

```bash
make
```

This runs inside a container and outputs packages into `./packaging/`.

To build for a specific distro:

```bash
make ubuntu22.04   # or rocky9, tumbleweed, etc.
```

Use `make help` to list all currently supported distros. Adding new distro support is always welcomed!

### Install locally

```bash
sudo make install
```

### Uninstall

```bash
sudo make uninstall
```

## Coding Guidelines

* **Rust Style:** Run `cargo fmt` before committing.
* **Linting:** Use `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features` to catch common issues.
* **Testing:** Run `cargo test` before opening a PR.
* **Commits:** Write clear commit messages in the imperative mood (e.g., ‚ÄúAdd Intune compliance check‚Äù). Add a signed-off tag to each commit (`git commit --signoff`).
* **Docs:** Update relevant documentation/man pages when you change functionality.

---

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch (`git checkout -b my-name/my-feature`).
2. Ensure your code builds and tests pass.
3. Manually test the feature change.
4. If applicable, update:

   * Tests
   * Documentation/man pages
   * Packaging
5. Open a PR against `main`.
6. Request a review from a maintainer.

Commits should be small and focused. Large changes are easier to merge if split into smaller parts.

---

## Issues

* Use clear, descriptive titles.
* Include environment details (distro, Himmelblau version, logs, etc).
* For bugs: provide steps to reproduce.
* For features: explain use case and benefit.

---

## Packaging Notes

Himmelblau supports multiple distros. Packaging information lives in various Cargo.toml files throughout the project.
If contributing packaging fixes, test on at least one supported distro and note which in your PR.
